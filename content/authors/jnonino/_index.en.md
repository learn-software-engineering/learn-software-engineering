I'm a computer engineer who has been thriving in the software industry since 2013. My entire career has been driven by an insatiable curiosity for software engineering practices and a relentless pursuit of ways to refine the development process. My journey has seen me wear many hats, including those of a Software Developer, Configuration Manager, Scrum Master, DevOps Engineer, DevOps Consultant, and Platform Engineer.

What truly fuels my passion is not just the act of learning, but also the joy of sharing knowledge. This passion led me to the halls of academia, where I began my teaching journey with assistant positions in Physics courses during my early years at the university. My commitment to education did not stop there. After serving as a teacher's assistant for several years, I eagerly applied for and secured a position as an adjunct professor in the specialized courses of *Software Engineering* and *Software Quality Management*.

However, life is a journey filled with twists and opportunities. In 2020, I made the bittersweet decision to resign from my cherished adjunct professor role, as an exciting new chapter unfolded. A move to London beckoned, offering fresh horizons and the chance to immerse myself in a vibrant and innovative tech hub. Though I left a part of my heart in academia, the pursuit of excellence continues, and my passion for software engineering remains as strong as ever.

Join me as we explore the fascinating world of software engineering, a field that continues to evolve, inspire, and shape our future.
