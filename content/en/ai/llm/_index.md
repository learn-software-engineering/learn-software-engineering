In this module, you'll master the techniques that power today's most impressive AI applications. You'll learn prompt engineering and fine-tuning by creating a specialized AI assistant that serves a specific domain. You'll build a system that enhances LLMs with your own knowledge sources, making them experts in topics they weren't specifically trained on. Your multimodal project will enable AI to understand both images and text together, opening new possibilities for intelligent applications. Finally, you'll develop an autonomous AI agent that can reason through complex tasks and use tools to accomplish goals. These projects represent the frontier of today's AI capabilities and provide skills in extremely high demand.
