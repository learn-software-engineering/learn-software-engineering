description: >
  Stacks are an abstract data structure that operates under the LIFO (last in, first out) principle, where the last element to enter is the first to leave.

The **LIFO** nature of stacks is due to the fact that only the top element can be accessed and manipulated. The operation of placing an element on the stack is known as *"push"*, while removing an element from the stack is a *"pop"*. The LIFO operation causes the last element placed in a stack to be the first to be removed.

## Main operations

The primary operations supported by a stack structure are:

- **Push:** adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop:** removes the element at the top of the stack.
- **Peek:** allows accessing the top element without removing it from the stack.
- **isEmpty:** checks if the stack is empty.

Most languages like Python and Java provide stack implementations in their standard libraries.

## Implementation

A stack can be implemented using a linked list so that each node points to the previous node.

```python
class Node:
  def __init__(self, value):
    self.value = value
    self.previous = None


class Stack:
  def __init__(self):
    self.top = None
    self.size = 0

  def push(self, value):
    new_node = Node(value)
    if self.top is None:
      self.top = new_node
    else:
      new_node.previous = self.top
      self.top = new_node
    self.size += 1

  def pop(self):
    if self.top is None:
      return None
    top_node = self.top
    self.top = self.top.previous
    self.size -= 1
    return top_node.value

  def peek(self):
    if self.top is None:
      return None
    return self.top.value

  def is_empty(self):
    return self.top is None  # Returns true if top is None

  def __len__(self):
    return self.size

  def __str__(self):
    values = []
    current = self.top
    while current:
      values.append(str(current.value))
      current = current.previous
    return "\n".join(values)
```

## Usage examples

Stacks have many uses in programming:

- **Execution stack (call stack)**: records pending function calls to resolve. Implements expected LIFO behaviour.

- **Browser stack**: allows going back (undo) in the browser history similarly to a LIFO stack.

- **Math expression execution**: stacks can verify parentheses, brackets, braces, etc.

- **Algorithms and data structures**: like in the quicksort algorithm and in data path implementations.

## Conclusion

Stacks are versatile data structures thanks to their LIFO operation principle. Having a good command of stacks, their uses and applications is essential in computer science.
