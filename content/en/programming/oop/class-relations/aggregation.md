title: "Aggregation"
description: >
  Aggregation is a specialised form of association that represents a "whole-part" or "has-a" relationship between classes. In aggregation, one class (the whole) contains references to objects of another class (the part), but the part can exist independently of the whole.

Key characteristics of aggregation:
- It's a stronger relationship than a simple association, but weaker than composition.
- The "part" object can exist independently of the "whole" object.
- Multiple "whole" objects can share the same "part" object.
- If the "whole" object is destroyed, the "part" object continues to exist.

Let's look at an example to illustrate aggregation:

```python
class Department:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.employees = []

    def add_employee(self, employee):
        self.employees.append(employee)

    def remove_employee(self, employee):
        self.employees.remove(employee)

    def list_employees(self):
        return f"Department {self.name} has employees: {', '.join(emp.name for emp in self.employees)}"

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, id):
        self.name = name
        self.id = id

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Employee(name={self.name}, id={self.id})"

# Creating instances
hr_dept = Department("Human Resources")
it_dept = Department("Information Technology")

emp1 = Employee("Alice", "E001")
emp2 = Employee("Bob", "E002")
emp3 = Employee("Charlie", "E003")

# Adding employees to departments
hr_dept.add_employee(emp1)
hr_dept.add_employee(emp2)
it_dept.add_employee(emp2)  # Note: Bob works in both HR and IT
it_dept.add_employee(emp3)

print(hr_dept.list_employees())
print(it_dept.list_employees())

# If we remove the HR department, the employees still exist
del hr_dept
print(emp1)  # Employee still exists
```

In this example, we have an aggregation relationship between `Department` and `Employee`. A `Department` has `Employee`s, but `Employee`s can exist independently of any particular `Department`. Also, an `Employee` can belong to multiple `Department`s (as we see with Bob).

Here's a UML diagram representing this aggregation relationship:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Department {
        +name: string
        +employees: list
        +add_employee(employee)
        +remove_employee(employee)
        +list_employees()
    }
    class Employee {
        +name: string
        +id: string
        +__str__()
    }
    Department o-- Employee : has

```

In this diagram, the open diamond on the `Department` side of the relationship indicates aggregation. This shows that `Department` is the "whole" and `Employee` is the "part" in this relationship.

It's important to note that while aggregation implies a whole-part relationship, the "part" (in this case, `Employee`) can exist independently and can even be part of multiple "wholes" (multiple `Department`s).
