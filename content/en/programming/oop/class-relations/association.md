title: "Association"
description: >
  Association is the most basic and generic form of relationship between classes. It represents a connection between two classes where one class is aware of and can interact with another class. This relationship is often described as a "uses-a" relationship.

Key characteristics of association:
- It represents a loose coupling between classes.
- The associated classes can exist independently of each other.
- The lifetime of one class is not tied to the lifetime of the other.
- It can be unidirectional or bidirectional.

There are two main types of association:

1. Unidirectional Association
2. Bidirectional Association

Let's explore each of these in more detail.

### Unidirectional association

In a unidirectional association, one class knows about and can interact with another class, but not vice versa. This is a one-way relationship.

Here's an example in Python:

```python
class Customer:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

class Order:
    def __init__(self, order_number, customer):
        self.order_number = order_number
        self.customer = customer  # This creates an association

    def display_info(self):
        return f"Order {self.order_number} placed by {self.customer.name}"

# Creating instances
customer = Customer("John Doe")
order = Order("12345", customer)

print(order.display_info())  # Output: Order 12345 placed by John Doe
```

In this example, the `Order` class has a unidirectional association with the `Customer` class. An `Order` knows about its associated `Customer`, but a `Customer` doesn't know about its `Order`s.

Here's a UML diagram representing this relationship:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Customer {
        +name: string
    }
    class Order {
        +order_number: string
        +customer: Customer
        +display_info()
    }
    Order --> Customer : places

```

The arrow in the diagram points from `Order` to `Customer`, indicating that `Order` knows about `Customer`, but not the other way around.

### Bidirectional association

In a bidirectional association, both classes are aware of each other and can interact with each other. This is a two-way relationship.

Here's an example in Python:

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.courses = []

    def enroll(self, course):
        self.courses.append(course)
        course.add_student(self)

    def display_courses(self):
        return f"{self.name} is enrolled in: {', '.join(course.name for course in self.courses)}"

class Course:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.students = []

    def add_student(self, student):
        self.students.append(student)

    def display_students(self):
        return f"{self.name} has students: {', '.join(student.name for student in self.students)}"

# Creating instances
student1 = Student("Alice")
student2 = Student("Bob")
math_course = Course("Mathematics")
physics_course = Course("Physics")

# Enrolling students in courses
student1.enroll(math_course)
student1.enroll(physics_course)
student2.enroll(math_course)

print(student1.display_courses())
print(math_course.display_students())
```

In this example, there's a bidirectional association between `Student` and `Course`. A `Student` knows about their `Course`s, and a `Course` knows about its `Student`s.

Here's a UML diagram representing this relationship:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Student {
        +name: string
        +courses: list
        +enroll(course)
        +display_courses()
    }
    class Course {
        +name: string
        +students: list
        +add_student(student)
        +display_students()
    }
    Student "0..*" <--> "0..*" Course : enrolls in >

```

The double-headed arrow in the diagram indicates that both `Student` and `Course` are aware of each other. The "0..*" notation indicates that a `Student` can be enrolled in zero or more `Course`s, and a `Course` can have zero or more `Student`s.

Association is a flexible relationship that can represent many real-world connections between objects. It's important to choose between unidirectional and bidirectional associations carefully, as bidirectional associations can introduce more complexity and potential for errors if not managed properly.
