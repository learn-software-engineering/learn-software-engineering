title: "Dependency"
description: >
  Dependency is the weakest form of relationship between classes. It exists when one class uses another class, typically as a method parameter, local variable, or return type.

Key characteristics of dependency:
- It represents a "uses" relationship between classes.
- It's a weaker relationship compared to association, aggregation, or composition.
- Changes in the used class may affect the using class.

Here's an example to illustrate dependency:

```python
class Printer:
    def print_document(self, document):
        return f"Printing: {document.get_content()}"

class PDFDocument:
    def get_content(self):
        return "PDF content"

class WordDocument:
    def get_content(self):
        return "Word document content"

# Using the Printer
printer = Printer()
pdf = PDFDocument()
word = WordDocument()

print(printer.print_document(pdf))   # Output: Printing: PDF content
print(printer.print_document(word))  # Output: Printing: Word document content
```

In this example, the `Printer` class has a dependency on both `PDFDocument` and `WordDocument` classes. The `Printer` uses these classes in its `print_document` method, but it doesn't maintain a long-term relationship with them.

Here's a UML diagram representing these dependency relationships:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Printer {
        +print_document(document)
    }
    class PDFDocument {
        +get_content()
    }
    class WordDocument {
        +get_content()
    }
    Printer ..> PDFDocument : uses
    Printer ..> WordDocument : uses
```

In this diagram, the dashed arrows pointing from `Printer` to `PDFDocument` and `WordDocument` indicate dependency. This shows that `Printer` uses these classes, but doesn't have a stronger relationship with them.

Dependency is often used to reduce coupling between classes. By depending on abstractions (like interfaces) rather than concrete classes, we can make our code more flexible and easier to change.
