title: "Inheritance"
description: >
  Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass or base class). It represents an "is-a" relationship between classes.

Key characteristics of inheritance:
- It promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchy between classes.
- The subclass inherits all public and protected members from the superclass.
- The subclass can add its own members and override inherited members.
- It supports the concept of polymorphism.

Let's look at an example to illustrate inheritance:

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Meow!"

# Creating instances
dog = Dog("Buddy")
cat = Cat("Whiskers")

print(dog.speak())  # Output: Buddy says Woof!
print(cat.speak())  # Output: Whiskers says Meow!

# Demonstrating polymorphism
def animal_sound(animal):
    print(animal.speak())

animal_sound(dog)  # Output: Buddy says Woof!
animal_sound(cat)  # Output: Whiskers says Meow!
```

In this example, we have a base class `Animal` and two derived classes `Dog` and `Cat`. Both `Dog` and `Cat` inherit from `Animal` and override the `speak` method.

Here's a UML diagram representing this inheritance relationship:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Animal {
        +name: string
        +speak()
    }
    class Dog {
        +speak()
    }
    class Cat {
        +speak()
    }
    Animal <|-- Dog
    Animal <|-- Cat

```

In this diagram, the arrows pointing from `Dog` and `Cat` to `Animal` indicate inheritance. This shows that `Dog` and `Cat` are subclasses of `Animal`.

Inheritance is a powerful feature of OOP, but it should be used judiciously. Overuse of inheritance can lead to complex class hierarchies that are difficult to understand and maintain. The principle of **"composition over inheritance"** suggests that it's often better to use composition (*has-a* relationship) rather than inheritance (*is-a* relationship) when designing class relationships.
