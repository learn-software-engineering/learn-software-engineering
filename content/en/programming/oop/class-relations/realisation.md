title: "Realisation (Implementation)"
description: >
  Realisation, also known as implementation, is a relationship between a class and an interface. It indicates that a class implements the behaviour specified by an interface.

Key characteristics of realisation:
- It represents a contract that the implementing class must fulfil.
- The class must provide implementations for all methods declared in the interface.
- It allows for polymorphism through interfaces.

Python doesn't have a built-in interface concept like some other languages (e.g., Java), but we can simulate interfaces using abstract base classes. Here's an example:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Drawable(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def draw(self):
        pass

class Circle(Drawable):
    def draw(self):
        return "Drawing a circle"

class Square(Drawable):
    def draw(self):
        return "Drawing a square"

def draw_shape(shape: Drawable):
    print(shape.draw())

# Creating instances
circle = Circle()
square = Square()

# Using polymorphism through the interface
draw_shape(circle)  # Output: Drawing a circle
draw_shape(square)  # Output: Drawing a square
```

In this example, `Drawable` is an abstract base class that acts like an interface. Both `Circle` and `Square` implement the `Drawable` interface by providing their own implementation of the `draw` method.

Here's a UML diagram representing this realisation relationship:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Drawable {
        <<interface>>
        +draw()
    }
    class Circle {
        +draw()
    }
    class Square {
        +draw()
    }
    Drawable <|.. Circle
    Drawable <|.. Square

```

In this diagram, the dashed arrows pointing from `Circle` and `Square` to `Drawable` indicate realisation. This shows that `Circle` and `Square` implement the `Drawable` interface.

Realisation is a powerful concept that allows for designing loosely coupled systems. By programming to interfaces rather than concrete implementations, we can create more flexible and extensible software.
