title: SOLID principles
description: >
  The SOLID principles are fundamental guidelines in object-oriented programming that help developers create more maintainable, flexible, and scalable software. These principles, introduced by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob) in his 2000 paper "Design Principles and Design Patterns," have become cornerstone concepts in modern software engineering.

The acronym SOLID was coined by Michael Feathers and represents five essential principles:
- Single Responsibility principle
- Open-Closed principle
- Liskov Substitution principle
- Interface Segregation principle
- Dependency Inversion principle

Before diving into the principles themselves, it's important to understand their historical context. In the 1990s, as object-oriented programming gained popularity, developers faced numerous challenges with maintaining and scaling large codebases. The SOLID principles emerged as a response to common problems such as:

- Rigid designs that were difficult to modify
- Fragile code that broke in unexpected places
- Software that couldn't be reused effectively
- Systems that were hard to test and maintain

These principles were influenced by earlier work in software engineering, particularly:
- The Law of Demeter (1987)
- Design by Contract (1986)
- The Open-Closed Principle (1988)
