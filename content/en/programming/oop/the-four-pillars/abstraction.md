title: "Abstraction"
description: >
  Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It's about creating a simplified view of an object that represents its essential characteristics without including background details or explanations.

Key aspects of abstraction include:

1. **Simplification**: Abstraction reduces complexity by hiding unnecessary details.
2. **Focusing on essential features**: It emphasises what an object does rather than how it does it.
3. **Separation of concerns**: It allows separating the interface of a class from its implementation.
4. **Modularity**: Abstraction promotes modular design by defining clear boundaries between components.

### Abstract classes and interfaces

In many object-oriented languages, abstraction is implemented through abstract classes and interfaces. While Python doesn't have a built-in interface concept, we can achieve similar functionality using abstract base classes. Python's `abc` module provides infrastructure for defining abstract base classes:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def perimeter(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.width + self.height)

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14159 * self.radius ** 2

    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * 3.14159 * self.radius

# Usage
# shapes = [Shape()]  # This would raise TypeError
shapes = [Rectangle(5, 4), Circle(3)]

for shape in shapes:
    print(f"Area: {shape.area()}, Perimeter: {shape.perimeter()}")

# Output:
# Area: 20, Perimeter: 18
# Area: 28.27431, Perimeter: 18.84954
```

In this example:
- `Shape` is an abstract base class that defines the interface for all shapes.
- `Rectangle` and `Circle` are concrete classes that implement the `Shape` interface.
- We can't instantiate `Shape` directly, but we can use it as a common type for all shapes.

### Implementing abstraction in Python

While abstract base classes provide a formal way to define interfaces in Python, abstraction can also be achieved through convention and documentation. Here's an example of abstraction without using `ABC`:

```python
class Database:
    def connect(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclass must implement abstract method")

    def execute(self, query):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclass must implement abstract method")

class MySQLDatabase(Database):
    def connect(self):
        print("Connecting to MySQL database...")

    def execute(self, query):
        print(f"Executing MySQL query: {query}")

class PostgreSQLDatabase(Database):
    def connect(self):
        print("Connecting to PostgreSQL database...")

    def execute(self, query):
        print(f"Executing PostgreSQL query: {query}")

def perform_database_operation(database):
    database.connect()
    database.execute("SELECT * FROM users")

# Usage
mysql_db = MySQLDatabase()
postgres_db = PostgreSQLDatabase()

perform_database_operation(mysql_db)
perform_database_operation(postgres_db)

# Output:
# Connecting to MySQL database...
# Executing MySQL query: SELECT * FROM users
# Connecting to PostgreSQL database...
# Executing PostgreSQL query: SELECT * FROM users
```

In this example:
- `Database` is an abstract base class (though not using `ABC`) that defines the interface for all database types.
- `MySQLDatabase` and `PostgreSQLDatabase` are concrete implementations.
- `perform_database_operation` works with any object that adheres to the `Database` interface.

### Design principles and patterns

Abstraction is a key component of several important design principles and patterns:

1. **SOLID Principles**:
   - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
   - Open/Closed Principle (OCP).
   - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP).
   - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP).
   - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).

2. **Design Patterns**:
   - Factory method pattern.
   - Abstract factory pattern.
   - Strategy pattern.
   - Template method pattern.

Let's implement the Strategy Pattern as an example:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class SortStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def sort(self, data):
        pass

class BubbleSort(SortStrategy):
    def sort(self, data):
        print("Performing bubble sort")
        return sorted(data)  # Using Python's built-in sort for simplicity

class QuickSort(SortStrategy):
    def sort(self, data):
        print("Performing quick sort")
        return sorted(data)  # Using Python's built-in sort for simplicity

class Sorter:
    def __init__(self, strategy):
        self.strategy = strategy

    def sort(self, data):
        return self.strategy.sort(data)

# Usage
data = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]

bubble_sorter = Sorter(BubbleSort())
print(bubble_sorter.sort(data))

quick_sorter = Sorter(QuickSort())
print(quick_sorter.sort(data))

# Output:
# Performing bubble sort
# [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]
# Performing quick sort
# [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]
```

This Strategy Pattern example demonstrates how abstraction allows us to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. The `Sorter` class doesn't need to know the details of how each sorting algorithm works; it just knows that it can call the `sort` method on any `SortStrategy` object.
