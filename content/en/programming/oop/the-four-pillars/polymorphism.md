title: "Polymorphism"
description: >
  Polymorphism is a core concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. The term "polymorphism" comes from Greek, meaning "many forms". In OOP, it refers to the ability of a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types or classes).

Polymorphism enables writing flexible and reusable code by allowing us to work with objects at a more abstract level, without needing to know their specific types.

There are two main types of polymorphism in object-oriented programming:

1. **Compile-time polymorphism (Static polymorphism)**
   - Achieved through method *overloading*.
   - Resolved at compile time.

2. **Runtime polymorphism (Dynamic polymorphism)**
   - Achieved through method *overriding*.
   - Resolved at runtime.

Python primarily supports runtime polymorphism, as it is a dynamically typed language. However, we can demonstrate concepts similar to compile-time polymorphism as well.

Let's explore different aspects of polymorphism in Python:

### Duck typing

Python uses duck typing, which is a form of polymorphism. The idea is: "If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck." In other words, Python cares more about the methods an object has than the type of the object itself.

```python
class Duck:
    def speak(self):
        return "Quack quack!"

class Dog:
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof woof!"

class Cat:
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow meow!"

def animal_sound(animal):
    return animal.speak()

# Usage
duck = Duck()
dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

print(animal_sound(duck))  # Output: Quack quack!
print(animal_sound(dog))   # Output: Woof woof!
print(animal_sound(cat))   # Output: Meow meow!
```

In this example, `animal_sound()` works with any object that has a `speak()` method, regardless of its class.

### Method overriding

Method overriding is a key aspect of runtime polymorphism. It occurs when a derived class defines a method with the same name as a method in its base class.

```python
class Shape:
    def area(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14159 * self.radius ** 2

# Usage
shapes = [Rectangle(5, 4), Circle(3)]

for shape in shapes:
    print(f"Area: {shape.area()}")

# Output:
# Area: 20
# Area: 28.27431
```

Here, `Rectangle` and `Circle` both override the `area()` method of the `Shape` class.

### Operator overloading

Python allows operator overloading, which is a form of compile-time polymorphism. It allows the same operator to have different meanings depending on the operands.

```python
class Vector:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __add__(self, other):
        return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Vector({self.x}, {self.y})"

# Usage
v1 = Vector(2, 3)
v2 = Vector(3, 4)
v3 = v1 + v2

print(v3)  # Output: Vector(5, 7)
```

Here, we've overloaded the `+` operator for our `Vector` class.

### Abstract base classes

Python's `abc` module provides infrastructure for defining abstract base classes, which are a powerful way to define interfaces in Python.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def make_sound(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Meow!"

# Usage
def animal_sound(animal):
    return animal.make_sound()

dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

print(animal_sound(dog))  # Output: Woof!
print(animal_sound(cat))  # Output: Meow!

# This will raise a TypeError
# animal = Animal()
```

Abstract base classes cannot be instantiated and force derived classes to implement certain methods, ensuring a consistent interface.

### Real-world Applications <a name="polymorphism-applications"></a>

Polymorphism is widely used in real-world applications:

1. **GUI frameworks**: Different widgets (buttons, text boxes) can respond to common events (click, hover) in their own ways.
2. **Database interfaces**: Different database systems can implement a common interface for querying, allowing applications to work with various databases without changing code.
3. **Plugin systems**: Applications can work with plugins through a common interface, regardless of the specific implementation of each plugin.
4. **Game development**: Different game entities can share common behaviors (move, collide) but implement them differently.

Here's a simple example of a plugin system:

```python
class Plugin(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def process(self, data):
        pass

class UppercasePlugin(Plugin):
    def process(self, data):
        return data.upper()

class ReversePlugin(Plugin):
    def process(self, data):
        return data[::-1]

class Application:
    def __init__(self):
        self.plugins = []

    def add_plugin(self, plugin):
        self.plugins.append(plugin)

    def process_data(self, data):
        for plugin in self.plugins:
            data = plugin.process(data)
        return data

# Usage
app = Application()
app.add_plugin(UppercasePlugin())
app.add_plugin(ReversePlugin())

result = app.process_data("Hello, World!")
print(result)  # Output: !DLROW ,OLLEH
```

This example demonstrates how polymorphism allows the `Application` class to work with different plugins through a common interface.
