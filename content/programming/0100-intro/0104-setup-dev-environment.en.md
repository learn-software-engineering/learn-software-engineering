## Choosing a programming language

Choosing a programming language is the first and perhaps the most crucial step in the learning process. Several factors to consider when selecting a language include:

1. **Purpose**: What do you want to code for? If it's web development, JavaScript or PHP might be good options. If you're into data science, R or Python might be more appropriate.
2. **Community**: A language with an active community can be vital for beginners. A vibrant community usually means more resources, tutorials, and solutions available online.
3. **Learning curve**: Some languages are easier to pick up than others. It's essential to pick one that matches your experience level and patience.
4. **Job opportunities**: If you're eyeing a career in programming, researching the job market demand for various languages can be insightful.

While there are many valuable and potent languages, for the purpose of this course, we've chosen [**Python**](https://www.python.org/). This language is renowned for its simplicity and readability, making it ideal for those just starting out. Moreover, Python boasts an active community and a wide range of applications, from web development to artificial intelligence[^1].

### Installing Python

#### For Windows users:

1. Download the installer:
   - Visit the official Python website at [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
   - Click on the download link for the latest version of Python 3.x.
2. Run the installer:
   - Once the download is complete, locate and run the installer `.exe` file.
   - Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation. This step is crucial for making Python accessible from the Command Prompt.
   - Follow the installation prompts.
3. Verify installation:
   - Open the Command Prompt and type:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```
   - This should display the version of Python you just installed.

#### For Mac users:

1. Download the installer:
   - Visit the official Python website at [https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/)
   - Click on the download link for the latest version of Python 3.x.
2. Run the installer:
   - Once the download is complete, locate and run the `.pkg` file.
   - Follow the installation prompts.
3. Verify installation:
   - Open the Terminal and type:
     ```bash
     python3 --version
     ```
   - This should display the version of Python you just installed.

#### For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) users:

1. Update packages:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```
2. Install Python:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3
   ```
3. Verify installation:
   - After installation, you can check the version of Python installed by typing:
     ```bash
     python3 --version
     ```

## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

An IDE is a tool that streamlines application development by combining commonly-used functionalities into a single software package: code editor, compiler, debugger, and more. Choosing the right IDE can make the programming process more fluid and efficient.

When evaluating IDEs, consider:

1. **Language compatibility**: Not all IDEs are compatible with every programming language.
2. **Features**: Some IDEs offer features like auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and debugging tools.
3. **Extensions and plugins**: Being able to customize and extend your IDE through plugins can be extremely beneficial.
4. **Price**: There are free and paid IDEs. Evaluate whether the additional features of a paid IDE justify its cost.

For this course, we've selected [**Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It's a popular IDE that's free and open-source. It's known for its straightforward interface, a vast array of plugins, and its capability to handle multiple programming languages[^2]. Its active community ensures regular updates and a plethora of learning resources.

### Installing Visual Studio Code

#### For Windows users:

1. Download the installer:
   - Visit the official VS Code website at [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - Click on the "Download for Windows" button.
2. Run the installer:
   - Once the download is complete, locate and run the installer `.exe` file.
   - Follow the installation prompts, including accepting the license agreement and choosing the installation location.
3. Launch VS Code:
   - After installation, you can find VS Code in your Start menu.
   - Launch it, and you're ready to start coding!

#### For Mac users:

1. Download the installer:
   - Visit the official VS Code website at [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - Click on the "Download for Mac" button.
2. Install VS Code:
   - Once the download is complete, open the downloaded `.zip` file.
   - Drag the Visual Studio Code `.app` to the `Applications` folder, making it available in the Launchpad.
3. Launch VS Code:
   - Use Spotlight search or navigate to your Applications folder to launch VS Code.

#### For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) users:

1. Update packages and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install software-properties-common apt-transport-https wget
   ```
2. Download and install the key:
   ```bash
   wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -
   ```
3. Add the VS Code repository:
   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/vscode stable main"
   ```
4. Install Visual Studio Code:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install code
   ```
5. Launch VS Code:
   - You can start VS Code from the terminal by typing `code` or find it in your list of installed applications.

## Write and execute your first program

Once you've set up your programming environment, it's time to dive into coding.

### Hello, World!

This is arguably the most iconic program for beginners. It's simple, but it introduces you to the process of writing and executing code.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

### Triangle area and perimeter calculation

This program is a tad more intricate. It doesn't just print out a message; it also performs mathematical calculations.

```python
# User input
side1 = float(input("Enter the length of the first side: "))
side2 = float(input("Enter the length of the second side: "))
side3 = float(input("Enter the length of the third side: "))

# Perimeter calculation
perimeter = side1 + side2 + side3

# Area calculation using Heron's formula
s = perimeter / 2
area = (s*(s-side1)*(s-side2)*(s-side3)) ** 0.5

print(f"The triangle's perimeter is: {perimeter}")
print(f"The triangle's area is: {area:.2f}")
```
