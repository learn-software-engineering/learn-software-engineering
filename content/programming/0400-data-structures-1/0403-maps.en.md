A dictionary, or map, consists of a collection of key-value pairs. The key is used to access the associated value. Keys must be unique within a dictionary. Values can be repeated.

## Main operations

- **Add/update:** Inserts a key-value pair. If the key existed, its value is replaced.
    ```python
    dictionary['key'] = 'value'
    ```
- **Get value:** Accesses the value given a key.
    ```python
    value = dictionary['key']
    ```
- **Delete:** Removes a key-value pair from the dictionary.
    ```python
    del dictionary['key']
    ```
- **Traverse:** Iterate over the keys, values or pairs of the dictionary.
    ```python
    for key in dictionary:
      print(key, dictionary[key]) # key, value
    ```

## Creating a dictionary or map

The syntax for creating maps or dictionaries in Python is:

```python
empty_dictionary = {}

person = {
  'name': 'John',
  'age': 25
}
```

---

## Usage examples

Dictionaries are useful in many cases. Below are some examples.

### Objects and mappings

We can model objects and entities with key-value attributes:

```python
product = {
  'name': 'Smartphone',
  'price': 500,
  'brand': 'XYZ'
}
```

### Counts and frequencies

Counting occurrences of elements in sequences:

```python
text = "Hello world world"

frequencies = {}

for word in text.split():
    if word in frequencies:
        frequencies[word] += 1
    else:
        frequencies[word] = 1

print(frequencies)
# {'Hello': 1, 'world': 2}
```

### Storing and accessing data

As a high performance alternative to lists and arrays.

## Conclusion

Dictionaries are versatile data structures thanks to their fast access based on unique keys. They have uses in almost all programs, so mastering dictionaries is essential in any language.
